                    <p> I love to code. The problem, the solution, the
                        search for answers, the obstacles,
                        the hunt for buried treasure…I love it all! My love for learning and inquisitive nature are what
                        drew me to
                        coding, but it's the "art of coding" and the magic you can create with code that won't let me
                        go. Finding solutions to problems and then being able to impliment those solutions into a useful
                        product through code; Nothing can beat that ! The overwhelming feeling of satisfaction that
                        comes from conquering all of the obstacles on a tough project and achieving the end result of
                        code that is clean,concise, beautifully crafted and the solution to someone's problem---
                        Well,...the feeling that comes from helping others through code is unbelievable!
